    High Scores:
DONE    functionality 
        in-game indicators
    
    Menus:
        main menu
            --could be pretty minimalistic
            --pretty much just a: 
                start button
                level_pack selection
        game completed menu
            --would show your times on each level, and their difference from high scores
            --option to play again
            --option to save replay? <- this should probably only happen when a record is broken
    
    Settings:
DONE    separate files for default settings and user settings, so that user settings can be
            gitignored.
    
    Level Building:
        10 intro levels each with unique challenge and charm (2/10 complete)
            Basic Movement
DONE        Moving Platforms
            Walljumping
            Bad Blocks
            Saving Jumps
            Enemies
            Boost Jumps
DONE        Crushing
            ???
            ???
    
    Entities:
DONE    fix or remove switches
            --right now they suck
        blocks that fall when you stand on them too long
        blocks that poof in and out of existence
        
        unify Block, MovingBlock, BadBlock, and FinishBlock into one class
            --all do pretty much the same thing, right?
        
    Optimizations:
        collision detection
            --right now it's ~bad~
            
    Get rid of pygame built-in data structures:
DONE    use lists instead of groups
            --sorting by object type makes collision handling more stable with the push-out
                strategy

    Physics Glitches:
!!!     walljumping on a platform moving away from you
            --player needs to snap to moving vertical surfaces
DONE    weird smushes
            --probably need to look at velocities of blocks before smushing. A platform moving 
                diagonally upwards shouldn't crush you from below.
        friction affected by fps
            --character slides farther when fps is lower
        pretty much everything affected by fps
            --movement speed, jump height, etc. not a huge deal because fps will pretty much always
                be fixed at 60, but something isn't correct somewhere that's causing this behaviour.
                
    Clock:
DONE    time probably isn't accurate, or only accurate due to multiple mistakes 
            cancelling each other out lol
    
    Windows:
        dragging window freezes game (spelunky does this too so maybe it's ok)

    Art:
        animations?
            --would at least benefit from death animations
            --player/enemy animations of some kind would help too, even if the box just leans or
                stretches when moving, jumping, hanging on walls, etc.
        sprites?
            --would like to keep it minimalistic if using sprites at all.
DONE    level themes?
            --would give levels some character, even just having an "ice" theme that makes the 
                platforms light-blue instead of grey for example
   
    Replays:
        investigation
            how to store?
                --sequence of player inputs?
                    would allow for eventual server-side verification of level-completion
                    potentially delicate
                    future proof for graphical changes to the game
                    extremely not future proof to even slight physics changes
                --sequence of actor positions?
                    slightly more costly to store
                    cheap to play a replay
                    cannot be used to verify level-completion
                    would get complicated if graphics ever become more complex 
                        --how will animations work?
                            --good reason not to do animations?
            should they be saved with highscore data?
                --makes sense for your own scores, but what if you want to race someone else's 
                    ghosts?
            super meat boy style replay of all attempts upon completion of level?
                --would have to design levels to make dying more frequent
                    --doing this anyways
                    --would probably want to make deaths more 'juicy' as well
                        --ghosts would have to have juicy deaths as well...
                            --could design to be not so bad
                --would be super cool
                --requires some kind of skippable replay mode after each level
                    --would have to pause timer and sorta interfere with speedrunning flow (?)
                --current code probably can't handle 100s of actors going at once, especially if 
                    physics/collision calculations are required for each one
        functionality
        
    Level Builder:
        no
        
    Music/Sound:
        --adds a lot to the atmosphere, also to the annoyance
