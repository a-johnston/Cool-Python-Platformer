Hard Rules:
    levels should start and end with player moving to the right
    no leaps of faith
    no pixel-perfect maneuvers
    no insta-death at beginning of level without player action
    no situations where level becomes impossible to complete, forcing player to suicide 
    
Soft Guidelines:
    make sure it's obvious where the player should go
    always keep speedrunning in mind, don't stop player movement for no reason
        --especially don't create blockades that destroy the speedrunning potential
          of a level. see doctor mario's target test stage in ssbm for an example of this
    be mindful of what the player can and cannot see
        --in a cave level, make sure the player can't see outside the level from anywhere
          in the cave
