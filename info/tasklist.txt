    UI:
        countdown before each level
NO?     game completed menu
        high score menu
            view replays
    
    Main Menu:
        options
DONE        start full run
            single level mode
            edit mode
            select level path
            settings
            
    Player Functionality:
        something to make walkoff instant-wallsnaps easier
            --hold shift to do it automatically?
            --hold shift to prevent walking off? then release to slide down?

    Settings:
DONE    unify drawer settings with other settings
DONE    custom keybindings
            including shift & ctrl modifiers
    
    Entities:
        blocks that poof in and out of existence
            --can be done with step function
???     unify Block, MovingBlock, BadBlock, and FinishBlock into one class(?)
            --all do pretty much the same thing, right?
            --at very least, bad/finish blocks need to be able to move
        
    Optimizations:
        collision detection
            --right now it's n^2
        drawing
            --everything is drawn every frame
            
    Code Quality:
DONE    separate gamestates into different files
    
    Level Editor:
        ability to: 
            place blocks
            edit block attributes (just edit their json?)
                paaaaaaths
                themes
                spawn stuff
        clicking on overlapping blocks should toggle which one gets selected
            
    Level Storage:
        sort json attributes more reasonably (type, x, y, width, height)
        header file is stupid
            --should do something reasonable if no header file exists
DONE    make levels save to somewhere more reasonable
            --just overwrite original? safe enough with version control
        revive void level and make it appear on level load fail instead of crashing
    
    General Storage:
        make localdata folder for highscores and settings to live
            --that way level packs can be distributed without having to edit/remove your highscore files

    Physics Glitches:
!!!     walljumping on a platform moving away from you
            --player needs to snap to moving vertical surfaces
!!!     weird smushes
            --very wide blocks have issues crushing player
            --probably need to look at velocities of blocks before smushing. A platform moving 
                diagonally upwards shouldn't crush you from below.
        falling wallsnaps
            --feel very weird, pixel perfect spacing required to replicate. probably required 
                    for some optimal runs
            --should be removed, or made easier to perform
        when falling quickly, if player lands on a thin block it may treat it as a horizontal 
                collision instead of vertical
IGNORE? friction affected by fps
            --character slides farther when fps is lower
IGNORE? pretty much everything affected by fps
            --movement speed, jump height, etc. not a huge deal because fps will pretty much always
                be fixed at 60, but something isn't correct somewhere that's causing this behaviour.

    Art:
        animations?
            --would at least benefit from death animations
            --player/enemy animations of some kind would help too, even if the box just leans or
                stretches when moving, jumping, hanging on walls, etc.
        sprites?
            --would like to keep it minimalistic if using sprites at all.
        
    Music/Sound:
        --adds a lot to the atmosphere, also to the annoyance
