    UI:
???     countdown before each level
        game completed menu
            --show total time, total deaths, level individual times + deaths
            --buttons to: try again, go to main menu, view replay(?)
        high score menu
            --show grid of level #, name, best time, best run time, button to show replay
            --view replays
                --this would be cool
        level selection grid
            --complicated, should have image of level start + name + number
            --will have to load every level's json
                --might be expensive for large level pack
    
    Main Menu:
        options
DONE        start full run
            single level grind mode
                --need
            edit mode
                --a little complicated, should flip on dev mode and start game?
            select level path
                --just click on level path text on main menu to cycle lol?
                --wouldn't be good if you have a bunch for some reason
            settings
                player color
                    -- rgb text boxes, plus drawing of player with that color
                dev mode
                    -- true, false toggler on click
                keybindings
                    --editable text box for each action for now
            
    Player Functionality:
        something to make walkoff instant-wallsnaps easier
            --hold shift to do it automatically?
            --hold shift to prevent walking off? then release to slide down?

    Settings:
            allow shift & ctrl modifiers for keybindings
    
    Moving Blocks:
DONE    unify with bad, finish, normal blocks
DONE    use x,y as starting position, and make paths give a position relative to that
            --will make editing and unification much easier
        
    Optimizations:
        --game seems to run fine on my system
        collision detection
            --right now every actor is checked against every solid block
            solutions:
                --enforce max block size and use chunking to store blocks?
                --512 by 512 is probably plenty big enough
                --is this even the bottleneck?
        drawing
            --everything is drawn every frame
            solutions:
                --^^^chunking
            
    Code Quality:
        standardize privatization of vars and methods
            --a lot of work...
    
    Testing:
        --this requires either a collection of test levels (that require updating),
                or some autogeneration scheme
        level loading test
        level loading -> saving -> reloading test
        stress testing
            autogenerate level with x random blocks
        
    
    Level Editor:
        ability to: 
            place blocks
            edit block attributes (just edit their json?)
                paaaaaaths
                themes
                spawn stuff
            need to be able to see type of selected block
            
    Level Storage:
        header file is stupid
            --should do something reasonable if no header file exists
        revive void level and make it appear on level load fail instead of crashing
    
    General Storage:
        make localdata folder for highscores and settings to live
            --that way level packs can be distributed without having to edit/remove your highscore files
        store highscores as ticks, and remove awful unformat_time method

    Physics Glitches:
!!!     walljumping on a platform moving away from you
            --player needs to snap to moving vertical surfaces
!!!     weird smushes
            --very wide blocks have issues crushing player
            --probably need to look at velocities of blocks before smushing. A platform moving 
                diagonally upwards shouldn't crush you from below.
        falling wallsnaps
            --feel very weird, pixel perfect spacing required to replicate. probably required 
                    for some optimal runs
            --should be removed, or made easier to perform
        when falling quickly, if player lands on a thin block it may treat it as a horizontal 
                collision instead of vertical
IGNORE? friction affected by fps
            --character slides farther when fps is lower
IGNORE? pretty much everything affected by fps
            --movement speed, jump height, etc. not a huge deal because fps will pretty much always
                be fixed at 60, but something isn't correct somewhere that's causing this behaviour.

    Art:
        animations?
            --would at least benefit from death animations
            --player/enemy animations of some kind would help too, even if the box just leans or
                stretches when moving, jumping, hanging on walls, etc.
        sprites?
            --would like to keep it minimalistic if using sprites at all.
        
    Music/Sound:
        --adds a lot to the atmosphere, also to the annoyance
