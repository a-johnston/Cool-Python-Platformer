    Menus:
        main menu
            --could be pretty minimalistic
            --pretty much just a: 
                start button
                level_pack selection
NO?     game completed menu
            --would show your times on each level, and their difference from high scores
            --option to play again
            --option to save replay? <- this should probably only happen when a record is broken
        high score menu
            --see your scores
            
    Settings:
        way to edit settings in-game
        unify drawer settings with other settings
    
    Level Building:
        10 intro levels each with unique challenge and charm (3/10 complete)
DONE        Basic Movement
DONE        Moving Platforms
            Walljumping
            Bad Blocks
            Saving Jumps
            Enemies
            Boost Jumps
DONE        Crushing
            ???
            ???
    
    Entities:
        blocks that fall when you stand on them too long
            --is prone to create situations where a level becomes impossible
                to complete, violating level design principles
        blocks that poof in and out of existence
???     unify Block, MovingBlock, BadBlock, and FinishBlock into one class(?)
            --all do pretty much the same thing, right?
            --at very least, bad/finish blocks need to be able to move
DONE    blocks with individual themes
        moving blocks
            change functions to infix, or allow both
            unify json fields, no reason to have x, x_points, x_path
        
    Optimizations:
        collision detection
            --right now it's ~bad~
        drawing
            --also pretty bad
    
    Level Editor:
DONE    toggleable mode when dev_mode is enabled
        ability to: 
DONE        pan camera independently of actor position
DONE        select blocks
            place blocks
DONE        delete blocks
            edit block attributes (just edit their json?)
DONE            position
DONE            dimensions
                paaaaaaths
                themes
                spawn stuff
            zoom view in and out
DONE        save levels out (formatting issues?)
            
    Level Storage:
DONE    store paths and themes separately from their blocks, give blocks path_id and theme_id fields instead
            --will make editing paths easier in game
            --super needed for themes
DONE    custom json formatter to make easier to read
        sort json attributes more reasonably (type, x, y, width, height)
        header file is stupid
            --should levels know their own number?
                --what if they disagree?
        make levels save to somewhere more reasonable

    Physics Glitches:
!!!     walljumping on a platform moving away from you
            --player needs to snap to moving vertical surfaces
!!!     weird smushes
            --probably need to look at velocities of blocks before smushing. A platform moving 
                diagonally upwards shouldn't crush you from below.
IGNORE? friction affected by fps
            --character slides farther when fps is lower
IGNORE? pretty much everything affected by fps
            --movement speed, jump height, etc. not a huge deal because fps will pretty much always
                be fixed at 60, but something isn't correct somewhere that's causing this behaviour.
    Graphical:
        rendering order got booched somewhere
            --moving blocks should always be behind static ones
            --probably means physics calculations are out of order as well

    Art:
        animations?
            --would at least benefit from death animations
            --player/enemy animations of some kind would help too, even if the box just leans or
                stretches when moving, jumping, hanging on walls, etc.
        sprites?
            --would like to keep it minimalistic if using sprites at all.
   
    Replays:
        investigation
            how to store?
                --sequence of actor positions?
                    slightly more costly to store
                    cheap to play a replay
                    cannot be used to verify level-completion
                    would get complicated if graphics ever become more complex 
                        --how will animations work?
                            --good reason not to do animations?
                            --just store animation state along with actor pos?
            should they be saved with highscore data?
                --makes sense for your own scores, but what if you want to race someone else's 
                    ghosts?
NO          super meat boy style replay of all attempts upon completion of level?
                --would have to design levels to make dying more frequent
                    --doing this anyways
                    --would probably want to make deaths more 'juicy' as well
                        --ghosts would have to have juicy deaths as well...
                            --could design to be not so bad
                --would be super cool
                --requires some kind of skippable replay mode after each level
                    --would have to pause timer and sorta interfere with speedrunning flow (?)
                --current code probably can't handle 100s of actors going at once, especially if 
                    physics/collision calculations are required for each one
        
    Music/Sound:
        --adds a lot to the atmosphere, also to the annoyance
